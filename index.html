      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Jasper Chan Ting Chi, a 14-year-old from Hong Kong, was born in 2011. He began learning the violin at the age of 8, under the guidance of his teacher, Tang Hin Wah. By the age of 10, Jasper had successfully passed the ABRSM Grade 8 violin exam and received a music scholarship from Harrow International School Hong Kong. At the age of 12, Jasper achieved a Distinction in the ARSM Diploma in Music Performance – a testament to his refined artistry and dedication.</p>
      <p>At just 11 years old, Jasper made a name for himself in several international music competitions, winning multiple awards, including the championship titles at the GASCA Competitions, the Rococo International Music Competition, and the Hong Kong and Macau Outstanding Musicians Competition.</p>
      <p>At the age of 12, Jasper was accepted into the prestigious Purcell School for Young Musicians in the UK, marking the beginning of his serious musical journey.</p>
      <p>At 13, he was invited by renowned violinist Alda Dizdari to perform a solo at the St James’s Church, Piccadilly in London. His rendition of Brahms’ Scherzo in C Minor captivated the audience and garnered rave reviews for its “amazing beauty”. That same year, he was invited back to the same hall, further showcasing his potential as a rising star in the music world.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Jasper was invited to study at the esteemed Yehudi Menuhin School of Music in the UK, which has only about 90 students worldwide, highlighting his exceptional talent. Jasper currently studies under the guidance of renowned violinist and professor Natalia Lomeiko at this prestigious institution.</p>
      <p>On May 29th, 2025, Jasper gave his debut violin recital at the Lee Hysan Concert Hall in Hong Kong. The concert raised HK$100,380 in scholarships for students in engineering, arts, and elite athletics at CUHK’s New Asia College, reflecting Jasper’s commitment to giving back to society through art. His programme featured virtuosic works by J.S Bach, Mozart, Brahms, Béla Bartók, Bruch, and César Franck.</p>
      <p>Jasper currently performs on a 1742 ‘Lipinski’ Guarneri ‘Del Gesù’ model by Florian Leonhard Fine Violins, a renowned violin-making and collecting company. His bow was made in Dresden, Germany, around 1880 by Richard Weichold.</p>
