      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Jasper Chan Ting Chi, a 14-year-old from Hong Kong, was born in 2011. He began learning the violin at the age of 8 under the guidance of his teacher, Tang Hin Wah. By the age of 10, Jasper had successfully passed the ABRSM Grade 8 exam and received a music scholarship from Harrow International School Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>At just 11 years old, Jasper made a name for himself in several international music competitions, winning multiple awards, including the championship titles at the GASCA Competitions, the Rococo International Music Competition, and the Hong Kong and Macau Outstanding Musicians Competition.</p>
      <p>When he turned 12, Jasper achieved a distinction in the ABRSM Performance Level exam and was accepted into the prestigious Purcell School for Young Musicians in the UK, marking the beginning of his serious musical journey.</p>
      <p>At 13, he was invited by renowned violinist Alda Dizdari to perform a solo at the St James's Church, Piccadilly in London. His rendition of Brahms' Scherzo in C Minor captivated the audience and garnered rave reviews for its "amazing beauty." That same year, he was invited back to the same hall, further showcasing his potential as a rising star in the music world.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Jasper was invited to study at the esteemed Yehudi Menuhin School of Music in the UK, which has only about 80 students worldwide, highlighting his exceptional talent. Since September 2024, he has been studying under the renowned violinist Valeriy Sokolov at this prestigious institution.</p>
      <p>Jasper plays a 1742 'Lipinski' Guarneri 'Del Gesu' violin, which is on loan from Florian Leonhard Fine Violins, a renowned British violin-making and collecting company. His bow was made in Dresden, Germany, around 1880 by Richard Weichold.</p>
